            <h2>BATHING</h2>
            <h3>How to bathe a dog</h3>
        <p>
            <br>First, give your pet a good brushing to remove all dead hair and mats, and then put him or her in a tub or sink that's been filled with about three to four inches of lukewarm water.
            <br>Then, use a spray hose, large plastic pitcher or an unbreakable cup to completely wet your pet.
            <br>Take care to not spray or pour water directly in his ears, eyes or nose.
            <br>Gently massage in shampoo, working from head to tail, and rinse and repeat as needed.
            <br>Dry him or her thoroughly by giving your pet a good rub with a large towel. 
            <br>Voila, clean pet!
            <br>Dogs with loose facial skin or wrinkles—such as Shar Peis and Pugs—will need special attention.
            <br> To prevent dirt and bacteria from causing irritation and infection, clean the folds with damp cotton. <br><span style="font-weight: bolder"> Always thoroughly dry the areas between the folds.</span> 
        </p>
        <h3>Bathing a Puppy</h3>
        <p>
            Some pups think that bath time is a perfect time to act goofy! 
            Young puppies especially will wiggle and bounce all over the place, and tend to nip at bath time. 
            If this sounds like your pet, put a floating toy in the tub with her so she can focus on that rather than on mouthing you.
        </p>
        <h3>Choosing a Shampoo</h3>
        <p>
            Using a shampoo formulated for pets is best. 
            Human shampoos aren't toxic to pets, but some may contain fragrances or other substances that can irritate your pet's skin. 
            Select a product that's specifically formulated for your species of animal, as some ingredients may be harmful when applied to different types of pets. <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bolder">It's always smart to talk with your pet's veterinarian to make sure you're selecting a shampoo that will meet your pet's needs.</span>
 
        </p>
        <h3>Protecting Your Dog's Eyes and Ears During Bath Time</h3>
        <p>
            Since shampoos and soaps can be major irritants, ask your vet for a sterile eye lubricant to use during bathing—this will help protect your pet's eyes from shampoo.
             You can also use a sprayer or a showerhead with a long hose, allowing you to control water flow during rinsing. 
              Avoid shampooing your pet's head altogether by simply using a wet washcloth to gently remove any dirt or debris from his or her face.
                <br>
             <span style="font-weight: bolder">Protect your pet's ears, too, by placing a large cotton ball in each ear until the bath is over.</span> 
        </p>
        <h2>Brushing</h2>
        <h3>NECESSITY OF BRUSHING</h3>
        <p>Regular grooming with a brush or comb will help keep your pet's hair in good condition by removing dirt, spreading natural oils throughout her coat, preventing tangles and keeping her skin clean and irritant-free.
             Plus, grooming time is a great time to check for fleas 
             and flea dirt—those little black specks that indicate your pet is playing host to a flea family.</p>
             <h3>
                Smooth, Short Coats
             </h3>
             <p>
                If your dog has a smooth, short coat (like that of a Chihuahua, Boxer or Basset Hound), you only need to brush once a week. 
                Use a rubber brush to loosen dead skin and dirt and follow with bristle brush to remove dead hair. 
                Polish your low-maintenance pooch with a chamois cloth and she's ready to shine!
             </p>
             <h3>Short, dense Fur</h3>
             <p>
                If your dog has short, dense fur that's prone to matting, like that of a retriever, brushing once a week is fine. 
                Use a slicker brush to remove tangles and catch dead hair with a bristle brush. Don't forget to comb her tail!
             </p>
             <h3>Long, Silky Coats</h3>
             <p>
                If your dog has a long, luxurious coat, such as that of a Yorkshire terrier, she'll need daily attention. Every day you'll need to remove tangles with a slicker brush. 
                Next, brush her coat with a bristle brush. 
                If you have a long-haired dog with a coat like a collie's or an Afghan hound's, follow the steps above, but also be sure to comb through the fur and trim the hair around the feet.
             </p>
             <h3>Long Hair That's Frequently Matted</h3>
             <p>
                For long-haired pooches, it's a good idea to set up a daily grooming routine to remove tangles and prevent mats. 
                Gently tease out tangles with a slicker brush, and then brush your pet with a bristle brush. 
                If matting is particularly dense, you may try clipping the hair, taking care not to come near the skin
             </p>
        <h2>SHEDDING</h2>
        <h3>How to minimize shedding</h3>
        <p>
            While you cannot stop a healthy dog from normal shedding, you can reduce the amount of hair in your home by brushing your dog regularly. 
            <span style="font-weight: bolder">Ask your veterinarian or groomer to recommend a specific type of brush or comb that will work best for your dog’s hair type.</span>
        </p>
        <h2>dental care</h2>
        <h3>NECESSITY OF BRUSHING TEETH</h3>
        <p>
            Regularly brushing your dog's teeth, along with a healthy diet and plenty of chew toys, can go a long way toward keeping her mouth healthy. 
            Bacteria and plaque-forming foods can cause build-up on a dog's teeth.
             This can harden into tartar, potentially causing gingivitis, receding gums and tooth loss.
              Many pooches show signs of gum disease by the time they're four years old because they aren't provided with proper mouth care.
        </p>
        <h3>Choosing toothpaste</h3>
        <p>
            Do not use human toothpaste, which can irritate a dog's stomach. Instead, ask your vet for toothpaste made especially for canines or make a paste out of baking soda and water.
        </p>
        <h3>bad breath</h3>
        <p>
            If your dog's breath is not a field of lilies, that's okay. Normal doggie-breath isn't particularly fresh-smelling. 
            Halitosis, or bad breath, can be the first sign of a mouth problem and is caused by bacteria growing from food particles caught between the teeth or by gum infection.
             Certain dogs—particularly small ones—are especially prone to plaque and tartar. 
             If plaque is the culprit, your pet may require a professional cleaning and regular at home brushings are a great solution
        </p>
        <h3>signs of oral disease</h3>
        <p>
            Once a week, lift your pet's lips and examine his gums and teeth. The gums should be pink, not white or red, and should show no signs of swelling. His teeth should be clean, without any brownish tartar. A veterinary exam beforehand may be helpful to find out if your dog's gums are inflamed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bolder">Bad breath, excessive drooling, loose teeth, inflamed gums, tumors in the gums or cysts under the tongue are signs that your dog may have a problem in his mouth or gastrointestinal system and should be checked by a veterinarian.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Other Ways to Prevent Dental Problems</h3>
        <p>
            Give your pooch treats that are specially formulated to keep canine teeth healthy, and ask your vet about a specially formulated dry food that can slow down the formation of plaque and tartar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chew toys are also a great way to satisfy your dog''s natural desire to chomp while making his or her teeth strong. Gnawing on a chew toy can help massage the gums and keep teeth clean by scraping away soft tartar, plus it also reduces your dog's overall stress level and prevents boredom. Ask your vet to recommend toxin-free rawhide, nylon and rubber chew toys.
        </p>
        <h2>Eye care</h2>
        <h3>NECESSITY OF EYE CARE</h3>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bolder">Giving your pup regular home eye exams will help keep you alert to any tearing, cloudiness or inflammation that may indicate a health problem. </span>
            <br>First, face your dog in a brightly lit area and look into his eyes. 
            <br>They should be clear and bright, and the area around the eyeball should be white. 
            <br>The pupils should be equal in size and there shouldn't be tearing, discharge or any crust in the corners of his eyes.
            <br>With your thumb, gently roll down your dog's lower eyelid and look at the lining. 
            <span style="font-weight: bolder"><br>It should be pink, not red or white. </span>
        </p>
        <h3>HOW TO CLEAN A DOG'S EYES</h3>
        <p>
            A gentle wipe with a damp cotton ball will help to keep your pet's eyes gunk-free.
             Wipe outward from the inner corner of the eye and be careful not to touch his or her eyeball—you don't want to scratch the cornea! <br>
             <span style="font-weight: bolder">If your pet constantly suffers from runny eyes and discharge, please see your veterinarian.<br> Your pet may have an infection or plugged tear ducts.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>PREVENTING EYE PROBLEMS</h3>
        <p>
            Long-haired breeds can get eye damage if their locks aren't tamed. 
            Carefully trim the hair around your dog's eyes to keep his vision clear and prevent hairs from poking and scratching. 
            Soaps and topical medications can be major irritants, so sure to protect your dog's eyes before bathing him or applying ointments or flea-control formulas.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's much safer to drive with the windows only partially 
            down and your dog's head inside the vehicle to prevent pain or long-last injury from road debris or an insect getting in her eyes.
             The wind can also dry out your dog's eyes, possibly causing irritation and infection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider doing a little research to find out if your dog's breed is predisposed toward eye conditions, such as glaucoma or progressive retinal atrophy. 
            Your pet should have his eyes checked on annual vet visits, but knowing about possible inherited problems will help you take important precautions.
        </p>
        <h2>EAR CARE</h2>
        <h3>NECESSITY OF EAR CARE</h3>
        <p>
            Your dogs regular grooming routine should include regular ear checks. This is especially important for dogs who produce excessive earwax or have a lot of inner-ear hair.
             Don't clean your dogs ears so frequently or deeply as to cause irritation, and take care to never insert anything into your dog's ear canal—probing inside can cause trauma or infection!
        </p>
        <h3>EAR INFECTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            Because a dog's ear canals plunge downward and then horizontally from the ear opening, it is difficult for caught debris or water to be released, making canines especially susceptible to ear infections.
             Check your dog's ears regularly for discharge, odor, swelling and other signs of infection. 
             <span style="font-weight: bolder">If your dog is showing any of the symptoms described below, see your veterinarian as soon as possible.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Ear Care for dogs who swim</h3>
        <p>
            Frequent bathing or swimming can lead to ear irritation and infection. To prevent this from happening, place cotton in your dog's ears before baths and be sure to dry his or her ears thoroughly after water sports and activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your dog is prone to ear infections, as your veterinarian to recommend an ear drying solution made for dogs to help evaporate any water trapped inside the ear canal. These ear washes, usually witch hazel-based, are available at better pet supply stores.
        </p>
        <h3>Signs of ear problems</h3>
        <p>
            Because of the twisty, curvy design a dog’s inner ears, it’s easy for parasites, bacteria and yeast to hide in them and infections can often arise as a result of this trapped debris.
             Dogs with allergies are particularly vulnerable to complications, as are those with floppy ears, like Cocker spaniels, Basset Hounds and Poodles.
              Brown or black ear wax—and dry, dark wax resembling coffee grounds—are classic indicators of microscopic ear mites.
              <span style="font-weight: bolder"> Only your vet can tell for sure, so please don’t delay bringing your pooch in for a checkup.</span>
        </p>  
        <h2>nail care</h2>
        <h3>nail care NECESSITY</h3>
        <p>
            As a rule of thumb, a dog’s nails should be trimmed when they just about touch the ground when he or she walks. If your pet’s nails are clicking or getting snagged on the floor, it’s time for a trim. For leisurely living dogs, this might mean weekly pedicures, while urban pooches who stalk rough city sidewalks can go longer between clippings
        </p>
        <h3>finding nail clippers for your dog</h3>
        <p>
            There are two basic styles of nail clippers for dogs: a scissors type and a guillotine type. They both work equally well, so choose the design that you’re most comfortable with.

            If your dog finds both kinds of clippers intolerable, an alternative tool is a nail grinder, an electric tool that sands nails down. These offer great control, but take longer than clippers and some people (and dogs) find the sounds and vibrations they produce unpleasant. Ask your veterinarian or groomer for advice about what types of nail trimmers are best for your dog and how to use them properly.
            
        </p>
        <h3>Helping dogs with sensitive feet</h3>
        <p>
            Some dogs don’t like to have their feet touched, so it’s always a good idea to get your dog used to it before you attempt to clip his nails—ideally, this should start when he’s a pup. Rub your hand up and down the leg and then gently press each individual toe, and be sure to give her lots of praise and treats! Within a week or two of daily foot massage, your dog should feel more comfortable with a nail trim.

            Before beginning a pup pedicure, tire your dog out with some vigorous exercise and enlist an assistant to help you hold her down.
        </p>
        <h3>What to do if you cut your dog's quick</h3>
        <p>
            If you do hit the quick, your dog will probably yelp and might even struggle. This is a good time to end the session—but not before applying styptic powder or corn starch to the bleeding nail tip. Apply a little bit of pressure as you press the powder into the wound to make sure it sticks. If bleeding continues for more than a few minutes, please alert your veterinarian, who can check your dog for clotting disorders.
        </p>
        <h3>helping fearful dogs</h3>
        <p>
            Some dogs show fearful or aggressive behavior when faced with nail trimming. Watch carefully for signs of distress such as panting, drooling, trembling, whining, freezing, cowering, tail-tucking, growling, snarling or snapping. Even with the most patient and gradual of introductions, there are dogs who seem unable to get over their terror.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your dog falls into this category, do not force him to submit. See if his veterinarian or a professional groomer has better luck getting the job done—if not, it’s a good idea to make an appointment with a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB) or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) to work on the underlying issues at hand
        </p>
        <h2>Paw care</h2>
        <h3>necessity of paw care</h3>
        <p>
            The pads on the bottom of your pups feet provide extra cushioning to help protect bones and joints from shock, provide insulation against extreme weather, aid walking on rough ground and protect tissue deep within the paw. It’s important to check your pet’s feet regularly to make sure they’re free of wounds, infections or foreign objects that can become lodged.
        </p>
        <p>
            To keep them in tip-top shape, look for foxtails, pebbles, small bits of broken glass and other debris. Remove any splinters or debris gently with tweezers. Then, comb and trim the hair between the toes to be even with the pads to avoid painful matting.
        </p>
        <h3>using moisturizer</h3>
        <p>
            If your dog’s pads have become cracked and dry, ask your veterinarian for a good pad moisturizer and use as directed. Avoid human hand moisturizers, which can soften the pads and lead to injury. A paw message will relax your dog and promote better circulation. Start by rubbing between the pads on the bottom of the paw, and then rub between each toe.
        </p>
        <h3>treating wounds</h3>
        <p>
            It’s not unusual for dogs to suffer cuts or wounds from accidently stepping on glass, debris or other objects. Wounds that are smaller than a half inch in diameter can be cleaned with an antibacterial wash and wrapped with a light bandage. For deeper paw cuts, see your veterinarian for treatment.
        </p>
        <h3>Winter and summer paw care</h3>
        <p>
            As with humans, your dog’s paws will require different types of care depending on the season. The bitter cold of winter can cause chapping and cracking in your dog’s paws. Rock salt and chemical ice melters can cause sores, infection and blistering, and toxic chemicals can also be ingested by your dog when he licks his paws. Beat these wintertime blues by washing your dog’s paws in warm water after outdoor walks to rinse away salt and chemicals. You may wish to apply Vaseline, a great salt barrier, to your pet’s pads before each walk—or make sure your dog wears doggie booties.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the summer, it’s important to remember your dog’s paws feel heat extremes. Just imagine stepping barefoot onto hot pavement—ouch! To prevent burns and blisters, avoid walking your dog on hot pavement or sand. Watch for blisters, loose flaps of skin and red, ulcerated patches on your pet’s pads. For minor burns, apply antibacterial wash to the paw and cover with a loose bandage. For serious burns, please visit your vet immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Preventing Paw Problems</h3>
        <p>
            When starting a new exercise program with your dog, start off slow. Paws may become sensitive, chaffed or cracked, particularly when starting your dog out on hikes or runs. Be sure to keep your home and yard clear of pointy bits and pieces, and avoid hazards such as broken glass and other debris when walking your dog. Always keep this simple tip in mind—if you wouldn’t like to walk barefoot on it, neither will your dog!
